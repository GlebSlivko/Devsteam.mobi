### Reflection
The task was to implement a gallery based on React-Native (not React.js) which will display photos from unsplash. 
This application should retrieve the resource in JSON format.I started this process by initiating 
the application through the React Native CLI using the command - react-native init TestApp. 
I also used the expo (expo-cli@3.5).I implemented the concept of asynchrony in actions.Also, the redux thunk library helped me in this.
In my work, I mostly use React. React - Native was a new technology for me,so the task took me 2 days. 
I really liked the task.I understood from scratch and successfully completed it. 
I plan to develop further as a react-native developer, 
because I am most effective in tasks and technologies of this type.

In the end, the technologies implemented in this project are React-Native, Redux + Async Redux library (redux-thunk),
React Navigation, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX and CSS. 
I decided to use the create-responsive application template to minimize initial setup and devote more 
time to immersion in a new technology for me. In the next iteration, I plan to dive deeper into the react-native 
technology.
